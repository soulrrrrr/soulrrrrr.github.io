Just a reminder: today, I cared too much about others' opinions and ended up missing out on lot of things -- meeting new friends, chatting with recruiters, deciding how to use my time, etc. Today will be my last day caring about what others think. I will be myself every next day and take responsibility for my own life.

Derek Sivers once said, “If you’re not feeling ‘hell yeah,’ then say no.” I will live by these words from now on.
