I think that after this semester ends, I should find some books about writing skills and to learn, since I
believe that writing skills will become the most important skills in the future. Everyone is able to write
grammarly correct articles with the help of ChatGPT, however, I feel like those words are not the real words
I really want to say. So I would like to improve my writing skills to practive how to convey my idea clearly.

Actually I think I am not that nervous. I just feel like this will be an experience I have never had, and 
really excited about how will the interview goes. Hope everything goes well!
