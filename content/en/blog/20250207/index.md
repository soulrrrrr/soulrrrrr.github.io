Basically I was doing nothing. The coursework is easier than I thought, so I
went skiing and started playing nonsense phone games again (but it was fun!).
I feel like I have plenty of time, but I don't know how to use it. Spending
all of it on reading could be a good idea, but I find myself craving to talk
to people while also being afraid of rejection. Such a contradiction.
