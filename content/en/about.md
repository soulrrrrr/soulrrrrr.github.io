#### I enjoy thinking

I like to start thinking from a trait or a perspective of mine. Below is an example:

*When I enter a new environment, I seldom speak and I usually observe the others quietly. I feel that I 
have to learn more about others by observing them in order to behave appropriately. Some people
would say this is "shy", but I think this could be a "lack of confidence". I am not confident about 
myself, thinking that others would look down on me if I showed my true self.
But no one shows their whole self when they first meet, so maybe it is not because of
confidence. Ah, I found it. It is because I'm "afraid of making mistakes". I don't
want to let the others think I am dumb. But everyone makes mistakes. What am I
worrying about? Maybe I care too much about what others think. Focus on myself.
But how much do I believe in myself and how much do I believe the others?*

Thinking doesn't always gives me answers. But often inspirations.

#### I enjoy reading

Reading is an indispensable part of my life. I am fortunate that
I had a childhood without easy access to electronic devices, where I developed
reading habits.

As a child and adolescent, I read for entertainment and fun, 
but now I read for learning and growth. Reading is the most effective way to
learn from the greatest people throughout the world and history. Although the purpose
changed, the enjoyment didn't change.
