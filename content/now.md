## Set up my domain
Now I finally have a domain [ctsai.me](ctsai.me) ! The setup was easier than I thought. I still can host this website using Github Pages, just need to setup some DNS stuff.

## Reading "The story of Philosophy"
This is a great book. It introduces some of the most important Western philosophers in the history. Reading philosophy books helps me think more throughly and clearly.

## Planning spring break trip
I have many travel ideas: Boston, Montreal & Quebec, Mexico, DC... still deciding where to go!
