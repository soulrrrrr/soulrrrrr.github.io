## Studying at UIUC
I am studying computer science at UIUC and expect to graduate in December 2025. I am looking for software engineer internships for Summer 2025!

## Planning fall break trip
We have an 8-day fall break during Thanksgiving week. I have many travel ideas: Alaska, Montreal & Quebec, Mexico, DC, New York... still deciding where to go!
